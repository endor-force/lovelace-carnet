Home-Assistant Lovelace card for carnet  


1. Download the images in the www folder and put them in /config/www

Optional, if you want the image to represent your car, log in to car-net on your computer and save the top image on the page as passat.png
Double check the dimensions of the image. The style below was set based on my image which is 820x461 pixels.

2. Put below content in your ui-lovelace.yaml
